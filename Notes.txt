1. jUnit creates new Test class instance for every @Test method run.

2. LifeCycle hooks:
	@BeforeEach and @AfterEach runs before and after every method run respectively.
	@BeforeAll and @AfterAll runs before the Test class' instance is created and when the instance is destroyed.
		- So how can you call a method before even the object is initialized ? 
			ANS = make the method static.
